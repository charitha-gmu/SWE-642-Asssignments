            <h2>About the Department</h2><br>
            <p>
                The Computer Science discipline is concerned with the design, analysis, implementation, maintenance, and
                evolution of computer-based systems, and their associated theoretical foundations. Computer science is
                powering the information revolution of the 21st century, and computer-based systems are used in every
                scholarly discipline, every sector of industry, and every walk of human life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Advanced computation tools and techniques are revolutionizing, transforming, and often automating the
                way
                we work, play, communicate, collaborate, and conduct business. Computational approaches are integral to
                a broad array of disciplines including computational natural and social sciences, bioinformatics, health
                informatics, digital humanities, and financial technology. In addition, the spread of computing
                throughout society has made the ethical use of computing a central concern to policymakers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Computer scientists must be well-grounded in the theory of computing and in its application to diverse
                areas, and they must be able to work closely with members of other professions that use computing. The
                department, therefore, offers a broad array of programs in computer science at both the undergraduate
                and
                graduate levels. Students who study this discipline can learn about a wide variety of concepts and
                methods in computer science—algorithms, artificial intelligence, computer networking, cyber security,
                databases, data mining, data structures, machine learning, operating systems, programming languages,
                robotics, software engineering—and they will explore effective and ethical applications of these
                concepts and methods.
            </p>
